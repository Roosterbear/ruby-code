# Integers divided by integers give us... Integers!
puts 5/2

# Floats divided by integers or floats result in...
puts 5.0/2
puts 7.0/3.0

# We can have functions in numbers!, what a beautiful thing!
puts (5.odd?)?'Ruby is the best':'Python is the best'
puts (7.odd?)?'7 is odd':'7 is not odd'
puts (8.even?)?'8 is even':'8 is not even'

puts (2.odd?)?'2 is odd':'2 is not odd'

# Between
puts 2.between?(1,3)

# Also we can convert
puts 100.to_f # To float
puts 5.5.to_i # To integer
